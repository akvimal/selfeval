        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "The /proc filesystem is a virtual filesystem that provides a kernel-side representation of system resources and process information. It allows users to access and modify kernel parameters, view system statistics, and monitor process activity. This filesystem is not used for temporary storage, external device mounting, or storing system configuration files, making option B the correct answer.",
